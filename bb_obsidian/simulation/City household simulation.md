What should be included in a household: 

- number of people in it --> poission distribution with different lambdas used for different casts
- total income --> combine the population sampling
- total consumption --> Keynes consumption function, based on total income and I need to figure out autonomous consumption (should be a little above the median income of the fourth class)
- job of head of household
- education of head of household
