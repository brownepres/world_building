### Some background lore: 

It is located in a different planet, which is yet to be explored (aka: did not image in yet)
On the planet there is a prosperous town [[City 1 ( name tdb)]] with some villages around it, which town I will use as a sandbox for my experiments. The city is on a plain. 
The planet has been inhabited for about the same time as Earth going through similar phases of development. Energy sources and scarce, main source include coal (which is highly discouraged) and other renewable like solar, wind and water. 

### Future plan/where I want it to be heading: 

The economy of Bungy Birodalom is heading right into a collapse, due to slowly exploiting all of its natural energy resources while not being able to supply enough from renewable sources. Eventually it will lead into skyrocketing energy prices and war over the last pieces of sunny lands or rivers, because the greed for constant improvement is stronger than the need for peace.  

### These are the underlying constrains of Bungy Birodalom: 

Physical constrains for now are the same as they are on planet Earth, as per I have very little knowledge of physics and probably would get lost in it. 
As per human intelligence and technological advancement they are around the early 2010s of planet Earth. 

##### Hard constraint: 
Due to very intense magnetic activity airplanes have never been invented. Moreover electric ground vehicles are extremely expensive to operate, therefore long-distance transport hasn't evolved further than active human labour or the use of animals. 

##### Society: 
Cast systems which contains of 4 casts. 
- **Miners and farmers**: the lowest cast, they cannot access education, most of the society does not even want to recognize their existence. They cannot live in the cities, only the surrounding villages. (15% of the population) 
- **Physical labour**: other physical labour workers, like construction workers, plumbers etc. Children are able to attend specialized school where they learn to read and write and their chosen profession. Labour workers are the silent majority in the society. They are permitted to live in the city. (55% of the population) 
- **Office workers**: numerous type of office workers, ranging between high value added accountants to less important yet office work type workers. Due to their overall higher salary and life quality there is a surplus of office workers, resulting in higher unemployment amongst them. (27% of the population)
- **Aristocracy**: a very limited society derived from the old times when aristocrats used to rule the empires. Their rights have not been vanished, aristocrats do not work, they own companies. (3% of the population)

##### Politics
A simple parliamentary system, where all 3 upper classes are represented (miners and farmers are not). However the representation is far from optimal. Aristocrats hold 50% of the chairs in the parliament, while office workers and physical labour workers hold 30% and 20% respectively. For every new law to be passed onto the society, a 50 + 1% of the parliament must vote for it, which creates a situation where if the working class was to change something at least one aristocrat must be convinced, and vice versa. 
The common in all three classes, is that they instinctively despise the fourth. 


What is one thing I want to change compared to our current world? 
How is the constitutional form? How does politics work here? Are they corrupt, or saint by default?
